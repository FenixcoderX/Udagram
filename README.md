# Hosting a Full-Stack Application

This project takes the full-stack application and deploy it to a cloud service provider AWS so that it is available to users. It uses the aws console to start and configure the services the application needs such as a database to store users information and a web server allowing the site to be discovered by users. 

The project also includes documentation and runbooks covering the operations of the deployment process:
